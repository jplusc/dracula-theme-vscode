Note, this is a personal clone of https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code/

The comments didn't quite have enough contrast for me -- probably due to my protan issue.
Otherwise, this is the same as dracula, just with a comment color tweak.


installing in VScode (windows):
```
git clone https://github.com/jplusc/dracula-theme-vscode.git %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.vscode\extensions\theme-dracula
cd /d %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.vscode\extensions\theme-dracula
npm install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jplusc/dracula-theme-vscode.git ~/.vscode/extensions/theme-dracula
$ cd ~/.vscode/extensions/theme-dracula

after the `npm build` you will have dracula.json under \theme\
and it can be selected from File -> Preferences -> Color Theam.  (Dracula and Dracula Soft)
